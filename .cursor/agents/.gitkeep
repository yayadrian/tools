# Cursor Agents Directory

This directory contains agent configurations with rules and plans.

Each agent should have its own subdirectory with:
- `rules.md` - Agent-specific rules and guidelines
- `plan.md` - Agent plans and workflows

Example structure:
```
.cursor/agents/
  ├── default/
  │   ├── rules.md
  │   └── plan.md
  └── your-agent/
      ├── rules.md
      └── plan.md
```
